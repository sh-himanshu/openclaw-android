# Playwright Install Option Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add Playwright as an optional tool in `oa --install`, with automatic Chromium dependency resolution, environment variable setup, and usage guide.

**Architecture:** New `scripts/install-playwright.sh` follows the existing delegated-script pattern (like `install-chromium.sh`). `install-tools.sh` gets a new menu entry right after Chromium. The install script checks Chromium dependency, installs `playwright-core` via npm, sets Playwright environment variables in `.bashrc`, and prints a usage guide.

**Tech Stack:** Bash, npm (playwright-core), Termux environment

### Task 1: Create `scripts/install-playwright.sh`

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/install-playwright.sh`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the install script**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-playwright.sh - Install Playwright for browser automation
# Usage: bash install-playwright.sh [install|update]
#
# What it does:
#   1. Ensure Chromium is installed (dependency)
#   2. Install playwright-core via npm global
#   3. Set Playwright environment variables in .bashrc
#   4. Print usage guide
#
# This script is WARN-level: failure does not abort the parent installer.

Write this to `scripts/install-playwright.sh`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Make the script executable**

Run: `chmod +x scripts/install-playwright.sh`

---

### Task 2: Add Playwright to `install-tools.sh`

**Files:**
- Modify: `install-tools.sh:79` (tool detection)
- Modify: `install-tools.sh:118` (flag declaration)
- Modify: `install-tools.sh:124` (user prompt — after Chromium)
- Modify: `install-tools.sh:135-137` (anything_selected check)
- Modify: `install-tools.sh:152` (NEEDS_TARBALL condition)
- Modify: `install-tools.sh:202-208` (installation phase — after Chromium)

- [ ] **Step 1: Add Playwright to tool detection**

After line 79 (`check_tool "Chromium" "chromium-browser"`), detect playwright-core via npm:

```bash
# Playwright detection — check via npm since it's a global npm package
if npm list -g playwright-core &>/dev/null 2>&1; then
    TOOL_STATUS["Playwright"]="installed"
    echo -e "  ${GREEN}[INSTALLED]${NC} Playwright"
else
    TOOL_STATUS["Playwright"]="not_installed"
    echo -e "  ${YELLOW}[NOT INSTALLED]${NC} Playwright"
fi
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add flag declaration**

After `INSTALL_CHROMIUM=false` (line 118), add:

```bash
INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT=false
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add user prompt after Chromium prompt**

After the Chromium prompt line (line 124), add:

```bash
if [ "${TOOL_STATUS[Playwright]}" = "not_installed" ] && ask_yn "  Install Playwright (browser automation library, requires Chromium)?"; then INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT=true; fi
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add to anything_selected check**

Add `INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT` to the for loop on line 135-137:

```bash
for var in INSTALL_TMUX INSTALL_TTYD INSTALL_DUFS INSTALL_ANDROID_TOOLS \
           INSTALL_CHROMIUM INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT INSTALL_CODE_SERVER INSTALL_OPENCODE INSTALL_CLAUDE_CODE \
           INSTALL_GEMINI_CLI INSTALL_CODEX_CLI; do
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Add NEEDS_TARBALL condition**

On line 152, add `INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT` to the condition:

```bash
if [ "$INSTALL_CODE_SERVER" = true ] || [ "$INSTALL_OPENCODE" = true ] || [ "$INSTALL_CHROMIUM" = true ] || [ "$INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT" = true ]; then
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Add installation block after Chromium**

After the Chromium installation block (after line 208), add:

```bash
if [ "$INSTALL_PLAYWRIGHT" = true ]; then
    if bash "$RELEASE_TMP/scripts/install-playwright.sh" install; then
        echo -e "${GREEN}[OK]${NC}   Playwright installed"
    else
        echo -e "${YELLOW}[WARN]${NC} Playwright installation failed (non-critical)"
    fi
fi
```

### Task 3: Verify

- [ ] **Step 1: Syntax check install-playwright.sh**

Run: `bash -n scripts/install-playwright.sh`
Expected: no output (no syntax errors)

- [ ] **Step 2: Syntax check install-tools.sh**

Run: `bash -n install-tools.sh`
Expected: no output (no syntax errors)

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify Playwright detection logic handles missing npm gracefully**

Run: `grep -n "npm list -g playwright-core" install-tools.sh`
Expected: the detection line appears in the tool detection section
